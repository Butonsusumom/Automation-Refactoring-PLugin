    Duplicated code occurs when identical or very similar code exists in more than one location within a project. This
    redundancy can lead to inconsistencies, bugs, and maintenance challenges, as changes in one place may need to be
    duplicated elsewhere. Eliminating duplicate code by abstraction or integration into reusable components reduces
    error potential and enhances code manageability.
