    Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. Exceeding complexity limits makes the code difficult to understand, maintain, and test. High complexity often indicates that a method or class has too many responsibilities or is handling too many scenarios, increasing the risk of defects. Keeping complexity within established limits enhances code clarity, maintainability, and overall reliability.
