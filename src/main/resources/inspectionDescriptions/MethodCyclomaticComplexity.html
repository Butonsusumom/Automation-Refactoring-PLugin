    Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. Exceeding
    complexity limits makes the code difficult to understand, maintain, and test. High complexity often indicates that a
    method or class has too many responsibilities or is handling too many scenarios, increasing the risk of defects.
    Keeping complexity within established limits enhances code clarity, maintainability, and overall reliability.
