    Exceeding allowed cyclomatic complexity can lead to code that is difficult to understand, maintain, and test, hampering software quality and increasing the likelihood of errors.
    By adhering to established complexity limits, developers can ensure code that is more readable, maintainable, and scalable, ultimately contributing to improved software reliability and efficiency.
