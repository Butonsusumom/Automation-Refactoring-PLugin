    Using '==' for enum comparison is appropriate due to enums being typesafe constants in Java. This approach ensures
    type safety and high performance by checking reference equality, which is reliable for enums because they are
    instantiated only once. Unlike equals(), using '==' avoids unnecessary method calls and improves code clarity and
    efficiency.
