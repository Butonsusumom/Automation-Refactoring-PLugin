    This smell arises when the same object is repeatedly created in the same way across different parts of a Java
    application. Creating multiple instances of the same object can lead to unnecessary memory usage and performance
    overhead. By identifying such patterns and refactoring to use shared instances or constants, code redundancy is
    reduced, improving maintainability and performance.
