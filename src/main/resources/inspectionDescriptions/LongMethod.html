    This code smell occurs when a method in Java exceeds recommended thresholds for length or complexity. Long methods
    can be difficult to read, troubleshoot, and test. They often do more than one thing, which violates the Single
    Responsibility Principle. Refactoring these methods into smaller, focused methods improves readability,
    maintainability, and facilitates easier testing.
